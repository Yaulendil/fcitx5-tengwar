# Fcitx5 Tengwar

An addon for [Fcitx5](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5) allowing direct input of J.R.R. Tolkien's [Tengwar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tengwar).
Makes use of [my transcriber](https://github.com/Yaulendil/tengwar-rs), written in Rust.

This allows for much more easily writing the Elven languages of Quenya and Sindarin.


## Installation

## Note

This project is in a very early state, and is mostly based on [this tutorial](https://www.fcitx-im.org/wiki/Develop_an_simple_input_method) because I have no idea what I am doing.
